    1.Sizing Elements
        1.Intrinsic Size
            Some elements have a natural size set by default, we call it Intrinsic Size.
        2.Extrinsic Size
            If we set a Specific Size to an element, we call an Extrinsic Size.

    2.Handling Overflow
        1)CSS Overflow Property
            Content overflow can be handled using the CSS overflow property.
            
        2)The overflow property has the following values:
            visible(default) - CSS tries to avoid data loss. Hence, the overflow: visible; is the default value for it.
            hidden- The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible.
            scroll- The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content.
            auto- It is similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary.

        3)overflow-x & overflow-y
            overflow-x To handle overflow in the horizontal direction.
            overflow-y To handle overflow in the vertical direction.

      Once upon a time, there was a tortoise and a hare. The tortoise was
      friendly and quiet. He did everything slowly. The hare was fast and rude.
      He did everything quickly. One day, the hare saw the tortoise and was so
      amused by it that he called him 'lazy'.
