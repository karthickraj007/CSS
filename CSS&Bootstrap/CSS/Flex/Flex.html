  1)Layout
      A Layout is a pattern to structure the information and arrange the elements on the website.

  2)Methods to Design a Layout
      Mainly, there are two methods that help design the webpage layout.
        1)Flexbox (stable)
            Flexbox is a layout method that helps to arrange the HTML elements in rows (horizontally) or columns (vertically).
        2)CSS Grid (Advanced & Fast growing but not stable)

  3)Flexbox Layout with CSS Properties
      To achieve flexbox layout CSS provides many properties, these are a few among them.
        1.display 2.flex-direction 3.justify-content 4.align-items 5.flex-wrap 6.align-self 7.align-content
        8.flex-flow 9.flex-grow 10.flex-basis 11.flex-shrink

          1)Display
            To achieve different Layouts, we can use CSS property display.
              display:flex; - For creating Flex Container

          2)Flex Direction
              The Flex Direction specifies the direction of the flex items in the Flexbox Container.

              1)When working with Flexbox layout, we need to think in terms of two axes.
                  1.Main Axis- It is specified by the flex-direction property.
                  2.Cross Axis- It runs perpendicular to the main axis.

              2)Flex Direction property can have the following values:
                  1.row- Direction of the flex items is horizontal.
                  2.column- Direction of the flex items is vertical.

          3)Justify Content -> main axis
            The justify-content property specifies the alignment of flex items along the main axis.
              1.flex-start(default) - All the elements will arrange to the start of the container.
              2.center- All the elements will arrange to the center of the container.
              3.flex-end- All the elements will arange to the end of the container.
              4.space-between- Left over space will be arranged in between the flex items.
              5.space-around- Every flex item will get space around them.

          4)Align Items -> cross axis
              The align-items property specifies the alignment of flex items along the cross axis.
                1.stretch(default)- Will stretch its available height.
                  Note -> it is applicable for Inline element also.
                2.flex-start- Will be at the starting of the flex container.
                3.center- Will be at the center of the avilable height.
                4.flex-end- Will be at the ending point of the available height.

          5)Flex Wrap
            The flex-wrap property arranges the flex items in multiple lines.
              1)nowrap(default)
              2)wrap
              3)wrap-reverse

          6)Align Self
            The align-self property specifies the alignment of Individual Flex Items along the cross axis.
            Align Self property can have the following values:
              1)flex-start
              2)center
              3)flex-end
              4)stretch
              5)auto(default) and more...

          7)flex-grow & flex-shrink
            Flex Items can Scale Up or Scale Down their size based on the available space
