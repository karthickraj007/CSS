<!-- When to use 'px' vs 'vw':

Use 'px' when you want to set an exact size for an element. It provides consistency across different screens and devices.

Use 'vw' when you want to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. It allows elements to scale based on the size of the viewport. -->
