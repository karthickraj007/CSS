<!-- grid system 
  => A collection of reusable code snippets to create Responsive Layout.
  => It is a 12 column grid system.->based on system grid-column width will change.
  => It is responsive.
  => It is easy to use.

grid system contain three things:
  (1)->Container=>The Purpose of the container is to hold Rows and columns.
  (2)->row=>The Purpose of Row is to wrap all the Columns.(all the columns shoud be inside the row)
  (3)->Column=>all the content should be placed inside the column.
             =>Bootstrap grid system uses 12 column system for layouting.
             =>we can create up to 12 columns across the page.
    
    column wrapping:
      important=>when more than 12 grid columns are placed in a single row, the extra columns will wrap in a new line.

How it works:
  A container consists of rows and columns.
  All the content should be placed inside these columns.

bootstrap follows:
    Mobile first Approach
      (1)->First design the layout of mobile version
      (2)=>This will be adopted by devices with larger sizes.

Container:
  The Bootstrap class name container provides us default left and right spacings starting from smaller devices for a better user experience

Fluid Container:
  The Bootstrap class name container-fluid is a full width container.
  If we donâ€™t need left and right spacings, we can use the Bootstrap class name container-fluid instead of container.
